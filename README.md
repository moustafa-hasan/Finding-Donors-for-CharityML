# Supervised Learning
## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

### Overview
CharityML is a fictitious charitable organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was created to provide financial support to people wanting to learn machine learning. After sending nearly 32,000 messages to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone who was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand the base of potential donors, CharityML has decided to send letters to Californians, but only to those most likely to donate to the charity.

### Project Goal
My goal in this project is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine the best algorithm to identify CharityML potential donors and reduce the overhead cost of sending mail. 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

The code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also need to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file for the code to run. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
