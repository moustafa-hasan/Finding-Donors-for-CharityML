    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "#### Real-world application of the model\n",
    "- Assess credit risk.\n",
    "#### The strengths of the model; when does it perform well?\n",
    "- Easier to implement, interpret, and very efficient to train.\n",
    "- Can easily extend to multiple classes(multinomial regression) and a natural probabilistic view of class predictions.\n",
    "- It not only provides a measure of how appropriate a predictor(coefficient size)is, but also its direction of association (positive or negative).\n",
    "- It is very fast at classifying unknown records.\n",
    "- Good accuracy for many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable.\n",
    "- It can interpret model coefficients as indicators of feature importance.\n",
    "- Logistic regression is less inclined to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets.\n",
    "#### The weaknesses of the model; when does it perform poorly?\n",
    "- Cannot predict continuous outcomes.\n",
    "- It can only be used to predict discrete functions. \n",
    "- It is tough to obtain complex relationships using logistic regression.\n",
    "- Requires that each data point be independent of all other data points.\n",
    "- Attempts to predict outcomes based on a set of independent variables, but logit models are vulnerable to overconfidence.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression needs that independent variables are linearly related to the log odds (log(p/(1-p)).\n",
    "#### Why this model a good candidate for the problem?\n",
    "- As our task is based on binary classification and the logistic regrission fits best when the task that the machine is learning is based on two values, or a binary classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Trees\n",
    "#### Real-world application of the model\n",
    "- Using demographic data to find prospective clients.\n",
    "#### The strengths of the model - When does it perform well?\n",
    "- Easy to read and interpret.\n",
    "- Easy to prepare.\n",
    "- Less data cleaning required.\n",
    "- Used to solve both classification and regression problems.\n",
    "#### The weaknesses of the model - When does it perform poorly?\n",
    "- Unstable nature.\n",
    "- Less effective in predicting the outcome of a continuous variable.\n",
    "#### Why this model a good candidate for the problem?\n",
    "- As Decision Trees can predict categoriacal target variable, more intuitive and are easier to explain to a non technical person, and it have high accuracy while saving the computional power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Boosting\n",
    "#### Real-world application of the model\n",
    "- Civil planning.\n",
    "#### The strengths of the model - When does it perform well?\n",
    "- Can optimize regression, classification, ranking.\n",
    "- Often provides predictive accuracy that cannot be trumped.\n",
    "- Flexibility.\n",
    "- No data pre-processing required.\n",
    "- Handles missing data.\n",
    "#### The weaknesses of the model - When does it perform poorly?\n",
    "- Continue improving to minimize all errors. This can overemphasize outliers and cause overfitting.\n",
    "- Computationally expensive.\n",
    "- The high flexibility results in many parameters that interact and influence heavily the behavior of the approach.\n",
    "- Less interpretative in nature.\n",
    "#### Why this model a good candidate for the problem?\n",
    "- As Gradient Boosting is proven to be one of the most powerful technique to build predictive classification models with high accuracy.\n",

    "#### What is GradientBoostingClassifier model?\n",
    "- It is a complex model that works by building weak prediction models using weak learners sequentially in which each model attempts to predict the error caused by the prediction of the previous model.\n",
    "- Every time the basic learning algorithm is applied, it generates a new weak expectation rule. This is an iterative process. After multiple iterations, the weak learners are combined to form a strong learner that predict a more accurate outcome.\n",
    "#### What is a weak learner?\n",
    "- A weak learner is any machine learning algorithm that provides accuracy higher than random guessing.\n",
    "- Decision trees are used as the weak learner in gradient boosting.\n",
    "#### What is decision trees?\n",
    "- A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.\n",
    "#### What is a random guessing?\n",
    "- A random guessing will be the case that have accuracy of around 50%.\n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
